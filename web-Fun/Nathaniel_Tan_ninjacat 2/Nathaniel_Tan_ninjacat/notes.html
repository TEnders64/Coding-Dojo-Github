Hi Nathaniel!

Great work on your assignment! 

Several things I would like to go over with you:

1. For purposes of cleaner file organization, please put all your imgs in a folder named however you like, such as "imgs"

Actually, that's all that I have to say. Super work on making your JS as concise as possible!!
